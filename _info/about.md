The team includes members from the [Institute of Software Integrated Systems](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/abhishek-dubey), [Cornell University](https://cee.cornell.edu/samitha/), [University of Houston](http://aronlaszka.com/), [University of Washington](https://faculty.washington.edu/ratliffl/), [University of Tennessee at Chattanooga](https://new.utc.edu/research/center-urban-informatics-and-progress), [University of South Carolina](https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/yuchechen.php), [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://energyenvironment.pnnl.gov/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=3014), and Siemens, CT. This team consists of people with complementary backgrounds in transit operations, transit optimization, simulations, and artificial intelligence. They have extensive prior experience in building transit and congestion performance indicators using machine-learning models that incorporate exogenous factors, such as weather, traffic, and public events. The [research efforts](https://www.us-ignite.org/apps/uszb33mfglsnyiz6mxdw6r/) that led to these projects have been ongoing for more than six years starting from the [White House's smart cities initiative](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/14/fact-sheet-administration-announces-new-smart-cities-initiative-help) and the first [Global Cities Team Challenge](https://pages.nist.gov/GCTC/). The project was started by a collaboration between the  [Smart and Resilient Computing for Physical Environments Lab (SCOPE)](https://scopelab.ai) and  [WeGo Nashville](https://m.nashvillemta.org/nashville-mta-mobile-homepage.asp) and [Chattanooga Regional Transit Authority](https://www.provagroup.net/contact/).
