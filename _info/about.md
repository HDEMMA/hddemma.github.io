The team includes members from the [Institute of Software Integrated Systems](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/abhishek-dubey), [Cornell University](https://cee.cornell.edu/samitha/), [University of Houston](http://aronlaszka.com/), [University of Washington](https://faculty.washington.edu/ratliffl/), [University of Tennessee at Chattanooga](https://new.utc.edu/research/center-urban-informatics-and-progress), [University of South Carolina](https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/yuchechen.php), [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://energyenvironment.pnnl.gov/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=3014), [Chattanooga Area Regional Transit Authority](https://www.provagroup.net/contact/) and [Siemens Corporate Technology](https://new.siemens.com/us/en/company/siemens-in-the-usa/princeton.html). This team consists of people with complementary backgrounds in transit operations, transit optimization, simulations, cyber-physical system, distributed system and software design and artificial intelligence. They have extensive prior experience in building transit and congestion performance indicators using machine-learning models that incorporate exogenous factors, such as weather, traffic, and public events. The [research efforts](https://www.us-ignite.org/apps/uszb33mfglsnyiz6mxdw6r/) that led to these projects have been ongoing for more than six years starting from the [White House's smart cities initiative](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/14/fact-sheet-administration-announces-new-smart-cities-initiative-help) and the first [Global Cities Team Challenge](https://pages.nist.gov/GCTC/). The project was started by a collaboration between the  [Smart and Resilient Computing for Physical Environments Lab (SCOPE)](https://scopelab.ai),  [WeGo Nashville](https://m.nashvillemta.org/nashville-mta-mobile-homepage.asp) and [Chattanooga Area Regional Transit Authority](https://www.gocarta.org/alt-flash/insidecarta.php).
