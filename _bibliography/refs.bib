  abstract     = {Residents in cities typically use third-party platforms such as Google Maps for route planning services. While providing near real-time processing, these state of the art centralized deployments are limited to multiprocessing environments in data centers. This raises privacy concerns, increases risk for critical data and causes vulnerability to network failure. In this paper, we propose to use decentralized road side units (RSU) (owned by the city) to perform route planning. We divide the city road network into grids, each assigned an RSU where traffic data is kept locally, increasing security and resiliency such that the system can perform even if some RSUs fail. Route generation is done in two steps. First, an optimal grid sequence is generated, prioritizing shortest path calculation accuracy but not RSU load. Second, we assign route planning tasks to the grids in the sequence. Keeping in mind RSU load and constraints, tasks can be allocated and executed in any non-optimal grid but with lower accuracy. We evaluate this system using Metropolitan Nashville road traffic data. We divided the area into 500 grids, configuring load and neighborhood sizes to meet delay constraints while maximizing model accuracy. The results show that there is a 30 percent decrease in processing time with a decrease in model accuracy of 99 percent to 92.3 percent, by simply increasing the search area to the optimal grid{\textquoteright}s immediate neighborhood.},

In this study, long-term transit bus monitoring data were utilized to empirically compare fuel consumption of diesel and hybrid buses under various driving conditions. Artificial neural network (ANN) based high-fidelity microscopic (1 Hz) and mesoscopic (5–60 min) fuel consumption models were developed for hybrid buses. The microscopic model contained 1 Hz driving, grade, and environment variables. The mesoscopic model aggregated 1 Hz data into 5 to 60-minute traffic pattern factors and predicted average fuel consumption over its duration. The prediction results show mean absolute percentage errors of 1–2\% for microscopic models and 5–8\% for mesoscopic models. The data were partitioned by different driving speeds, vehicle engine demand, and road grade to investigate their impacts on prediction performance.}

As such, citizens expect and require accurate information about real-time arrival/departures of transportation assets. As transit agencies enable large-scale integration of real-time sensors and support back-end data-driven decision support systems, the dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS) paradigm becomes a promising approach to make the system smarter by providing online model learning and multi-time scale analytics as part of the decision support system that is used in the DDDAS feedback loop. In this paper, we describe a system in use in Nashville and illustrate the analytic methods developed by our team. These methods use both historical as well as real-time streaming data for online bus arrival prediction. The historical data is used to build classifiers that enable us to create expected performance models as well as identify anomalies. These classifiers can be used to provide schedule adjustment feedback to the metro transit authority. We also show how these analytics services can be packaged into modular, distributed and resilient micro-services that can be deployed on both cloud back ends as well as edge computing resources.},

  abstract  = {Bus transit systems are the backbone of public transportation in the United States. An important indicator of the quality of service in such infrastructures is on-time performance at stops, with published transit schedules playing an integral role governing the level of success of the service. However there are relatively few optimization architectures leveraging stochastic search that focus on optimizing bus timetables with the objective of maximizing probability of bus arrivals at timepoints with delays within desired on-time ranges. In addition to this, there is a lack of substantial research considering monthly and seasonal variations of delay patterns integrated with such optimization strategies. To address these, this paper makes the following contributions to the corpus of studies on transit on-time performance optimization: (a) an unsupervised clustering mechanism is presented which groups months with similar seasonal delay patterns, (b) the problem is formulated as a single-objective optimization task and a greedy algorithm, a genetic algorithm (GA) as well as a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are employed to solve it, (c) a detailed discussion on empirical results comparing the algorithms are provided and sensitivity analysis on hyper-parameters of the heuristics are presented along with execution times, which will help practitioners looking at similar problems. The analyses conducted are insightful in the local context of improving public transit scheduling in the Nashville metro region as well as informative from a global perspective as an elaborate case study which builds upon the growing corpus of empirical studies using nature-inspired approaches to transit schedule optimization.},

  abstract      = {Public transit is central to cultivating equitable communities. Meanwhile, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 and associated social restrictions has radically transformed ridership behavior in urban areas. Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is that low-income and historically marginalized groups are not only the most susceptible to economic shifts but are also most reliant on public transportation. As revenue decreases, transit agencies are tasked with providing adequate public transportation services in an increasingly hostile economic environment. Transit agencies therefore have two primary concerns. First, how has COVID-19 impacted ridership and what is the new post-COVID normal? Second, how has ridership varied spatio-temporally and between socio-economic groups? In this work we provide a data-driven analysis of COVID-19's affect on public transit operations and identify temporal variation in ridership change. We then combine spatial distributions of ridership decline with local economic data to identify variation between socio-economic groups. We find that in Nashville and Chattanooga, TN, fixed-line bus ridership dropped by 66.9\% and 65.1\% from 2019 baselines before stabilizing at 48.4% and 42.8% declines respectively. The largest declines were during morning and evening commute time. Additionally, there was a significant difference in ridership decline between the highest-income areas and lowest-income areas (77\% vs 58\%) in Nashville.},

  abstract  = {Proliferation of shared urban mobility devices (SUMDs), particularly dockless e-scooters, has created opportunities for users with efficient, short trips, but raised management challenges for cities and regulators in terms of safety, infrastructure, and parking. There is a need in some high-demand areas for dedicated parking locations for dockless e-scooters and other devices. We propose the use of data generated by SUMD trips for establishing locations of parking facilities and assessing their required capacity and anticipated utilization. The problem objective is: find locations for a given number of parking facilities that maximize the number of trips that could reasonably be ended and parked at these facilities. Posed another way, what is the minimum number and best locations of parking facilities needed to cover a desired portion of trips at these facilities? In order to determine parking locations, areas of high-density trip destination points are found using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The dwell time of each device is used to estimate the number of devices parked in a location over time and the necessary capacity of the parking facility. The methodology is tested on a dataset of approximately 100,000 e-scooter trips at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, USA. We find DBSCAN to be the most effective algorithm at determining high-performing parking locations. A selection of 19 parking locations, is enough to capture roughly 25 percent of all trips in the dataset. The vast majority of parking facilities found require a mean capacity of 6 scooters when sized for the 98th percentile observed demand.},

ABSTRACT="Due to increasing concerns about environmental impact, operating costs, and
energy security, public transit agencies are seeking to reduce their fuel
use by employing electric vehicles (EVs). However, because of the high
upfront cost of EVs, most agencies can afford only mixed fleets of
internal-combustion and electric vehicles. Making the best use of these
mixed fleets presents a challenge for agencies since optimizing the
assignment of vehicles to transit routes, scheduling charging, etc. require
accurate predictions of electricity and fuel use. Recent advances in
sensor-based technologies, data analytics, and machine learning enable
remedying this situation; however, to the best of our knowledge, there
exists no framework that would integrate all relevant data into a
route-level prediction model for public transit. In this paper, we present
a novel framework for the data-driven prediction of route-level energy use
for mixed-vehicle transit fleets, which we evaluate using data collected
from the bus fleet of CARTA, the public transit authority of Chattanooga,
TN. We present a data collection and storage framework, which we use to
capture system-level data, including traffic and weather conditions, and
high-frequency vehicle-level data, including location traces, fuel or
electricity use, etc. We present domain-specific methods and algorithms for
integrating and cleansing data from various sources, including street and
elevation maps. Finally, we train and evaluate machine learning models,
including deep neural networks, decision trees, and linear regression, on
our integrated dataset. Our results show that neural networks provide
accurate estimates, while other models can help us discover relations
between energy use and factors such as road and weather conditions."

  abstract  = {This paper presents a data-driven approach for predicting the propagation of traffic congestion at road seg-ments as a function of the congestion in their neighboring segments. In the past, this problem has mostly been addressed by modelling the traffic congestion over some standard physical phenomenon through which it is difficult to capture all the modalities of such a dynamic and complex system. While other recent works have focused on applying a generalized data-driven technique on the whole network at once, they often ignore intersection characteristics. On the contrary, we propose a city-wide ensemble of intersection level connected LSTM models and propose mechanisms for identifying congestion events using the predictions from the networks. To reduce the search space of likely congestion sinks we use the likelihood of congestion propagation in neighboring road segments of a congestion source that we learn from the past historical data. We validated our congestion forecasting framework on the real world traffic data of Nashville, USA and identified the onset of congestion in each of the neighboring segments of any congestion source with an average precision of 0.9269 and an average recall of 0.9118 tested over ten congestion events.},

    abstract={While there are many advantages to electric public transit vehicles, they also pose new challenges for fleet operators. One key challenge is defining a charge scheduling policy that minimizes operating costs and power grid disruptions while maintaining schedule adherence. An uncoordinated policy could result in buses running out of charge before completing their trip, while a grid agnostic policy might incur higher energy costs or cause an adverse impact on the grid’s distribution system. We present a grid aware decision-theoretic framework for electric bus charge scheduling that accounts for energy price and grid load. The framework co-simulates models for traffic (Simulation of Urban Mobility) and the electric grid (GridLAB-D), which are used by a decision-theoretic planner to evaluate charging decisions with regard to their long-term effect on grid reliability and cost. We evaluated the framework on a simulation of Richland, WA’s bus and grid network, and found that it could save over $100k per year on operating costs for the city compared to greedy methods.},

  abstract={Public transit agencies struggle to maintain transit accessibility with reduced resources, unreliable ridership data, reduced vehicle capacities due to social distancing, and reduced services due to driver unavailability. In collaboration with transit agencies from two large metropolitan areas in the USA, we are designing novel approaches for addressing the afore-mentioned challenges by collecting accurate real-time ridership data, providing guidance to commuters, and performing operational optimization for public transit. We estimate rider-ship data using historical automated passenger counting data, conditional on a set of relevant determinants. Accurate ridership forecasting is essential to optimize the public transit schedule,  which is necessary to improve current fixed lines with on-demand transit. Also, passenger crowding has been a problem for public transportation since it deteriorates passengers' wellbeing and satisfaction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, passenger crowding has gained importance since it represents a  risk for social distancing violations. Therefore, we are creating optimization models to ensure that social distancing norms can be adequately followed while ensuring that the total demand for transit is met. We will then use accurate forecasts for operational optimization that includes \textit{(a)} proactive fixed-line schedule optimization based on predicted demand, \textit{(b)} dispatch of on-demand micro-transit, prioritizing at-risk populations, and \textit{(c)} allocation of vehicles to transit and cargo trips, considering exigent vehicle maintenance requirements (\textit{i.e.}, disinfection).

  abstract={Affordable public transit services are crucial for communities since they enable residents to access employment, education, and other services. 
Unfortunately, transit services that provide wide coverage tend to suffer from relatively low utilization, which results in high fuel usage per passenger per mile, leading to high operating costs and environmental impact.
Electric vehicles (EVs) can reduce energy costs and environmental impact, but most public transit agencies have to employ them in combination with conventional, internal-combustion engine vehicles due to the high upfront costs of EVs. 
To make the best use of such a mixed fleet of vehicles, transit agencies need to optimize route assignments and charging schedules, which presents a challenging problem for large transit networks. 
We introduce a novel problem formulation to minimize fuel and electricity use by assigning vehicles to transit trips and scheduling them for charging, while serving an existing fixed-route transit schedule. 
We present an integer program for optimal assignment and scheduling, and we propose polynomial-time heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms for larger networks. We evaluate our algorithms on the public transit service of Chattanooga, TN using operational data collected from transit vehicles.  Our results show that the proposed algorithms are scalable and can reduce energy use and, hence, environmental impact and operational costs. 
For Chattanooga, the proposed algorithms can save \$145,635 in energy costs and 576.7 metric tons of CO2 emission annually.},
