  abstract     = {Residents in cities typically use third-party platforms such as Google Maps for route planning services. While providing near real-time processing, these state of the art centralized deployments are limited to multiprocessing environments in data centers. This raises privacy concerns, increases risk for critical data and causes vulnerability to network failure. In this paper, we propose to use decentralized road side units (RSU) (owned by the city) to perform route planning. We divide the city road network into grids, each assigned an RSU where traffic data is kept locally, increasing security and resiliency such that the system can perform even if some RSUs fail. Route generation is done in two steps. First, an optimal grid sequence is generated, prioritizing shortest path calculation accuracy but not RSU load. Second, we assign route planning tasks to the grids in the sequence. Keeping in mind RSU load and constraints, tasks can be allocated and executed in any non-optimal grid but with lower accuracy. We evaluate this system using Metropolitan Nashville road traffic data. We divided the area into 500 grids, configuring load and neighborhood sizes to meet delay constraints while maximizing model accuracy. The results show that there is a 30 percent decrease in processing time with a decrease in model accuracy of 99 percent to 92.3 percent, by simply increasing the search area to the optimal grid{\textquoteright}s immediate neighborhood.},

  abstract  = {Public transit is a critical component of a smart and connected community. As such, citizens expect and require accurate information about real-time arrival/departures of transportation assets. As transit agencies enable large-scale integration of real-time sensors and support back-end data-driven decision support systems, the dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS) paradigm becomes a promising approach to make the system smarter by providing online model learning and multi-time scale analytics as part of the decision support system that is used in the DDDAS feedback loop. In this paper, we describe a system in use in Nashville and illustrate the analytic methods developed by our team. These methods use both historical as well as real-time streaming data for online bus arrival prediction. The historical data is used to build classifiers that enable us to create expected performance models as well as identify anomalies. These classifiers can be used to provide schedule adjustment feedback to the metro transit authority. We also show how these analytics services can be packaged into modular, distributed and resilient micro-services that can be deployed on both cloud back ends as well as edge computing resources.},

  abstract      = {Public transit is central to cultivating equitable communities. Meanwhile, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 and associated social restrictions has radically transformed ridership behavior in urban areas. Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is that low-income and historically marginalized groups are not only the most susceptible to economic shifts but are also most reliant on public transportation. As revenue decreases, transit agencies are tasked with providing adequate public transportation services in an increasingly hostile economic environment. Transit agencies therefore have two primary concerns. First, how has COVID-19 impacted ridership and what is the new post-COVID normal? Second, how has ridership varied spatio-temporally and between socio-economic groups? In this work we provide a data-driven analysis of COVID-19's affect on public transit operations and identify temporal variation in ridership change. We then combine spatial distributions of ridership decline with local economic data to identify variation between socio-economic groups. We find that in Nashville and Chattanooga, TN, fixed-line bus ridership dropped by 66.9\% and 65.1\% from 2019 baselines before stabilizing at 48.4% and 42.8% declines respectively. The largest declines were during morning and evening commute time. Additionally, there was a significant difference in ridership decline between the highest-income areas and lowest-income areas (77\% vs 58\%) in Nashville.},

  abstract  = {Proliferation of shared urban mobility devices (SUMDs), particularly dockless e-scooters, has created opportunities for users with efficient, short trips, but raised management challenges for cities and regulators in terms of safety, infrastructure, and parking. There is a need in some high-demand areas for dedicated parking locations for dockless e-scooters and other devices. We propose the use of data generated by SUMD trips for establishing locations of parking facilities and assessing their required capacity and anticipated utilization. The problem objective is: find locations for a given number of parking facilities that maximize the number of trips that could reasonably be ended and parked at these facilities. Posed another way, what is the minimum number and best locations of parking facilities needed to cover a desired portion of trips at these facilities? In order to determine parking locations, areas of high-density trip destination points are found using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The dwell time of each device is used to estimate the number of devices parked in a location over time and the necessary capacity of the parking facility. The methodology is tested on a dataset of approximately 100,000 e-scooter trips at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, USA. We find DBSCAN to be the most effective algorithm at determining high-performing parking locations. A selection of 19 parking locations, is enough to capture roughly 25 percent of all trips in the dataset. The vast majority of parking facilities found require a mean capacity of 6 scooters when sized for the 98th percentile observed demand.},

ABSTRACT="Due to increasing concerns about environmental impact, operating costs, and
energy security, public transit agencies are seeking to reduce their fuel
use by employing electric vehicles (EVs). However, because of the high
upfront cost of EVs, most agencies can afford only mixed fleets of
internal-combustion and electric vehicles. Making the best use of these
mixed fleets presents a challenge for agencies since optimizing the
assignment of vehicles to transit routes, scheduling charging, etc. require
accurate predictions of electricity and fuel use. Recent advances in
sensor-based technologies, data analytics, and machine learning enable
remedying this situation; however, to the best of our knowledge, there
exists no framework that would integrate all relevant data into a
route-level prediction model for public transit. In this paper, we present
a novel framework for the data-driven prediction of route-level energy use
for mixed-vehicle transit fleets, which we evaluate using data collected
from the bus fleet of CARTA, the public transit authority of Chattanooga,
TN. We present a data collection and storage framework, which we use to
capture system-level data, including traffic and weather conditions, and
high-frequency vehicle-level data, including location traces, fuel or
electricity use, etc. We present domain-specific methods and algorithms for
integrating and cleansing data from various sources, including street and
elevation maps. Finally, we train and evaluate machine learning models,
including deep neural networks, decision trees, and linear regression, on
our integrated dataset. Our results show that neural networks provide
accurate estimates, while other models can help us discover relations
between energy use and factors such as road and weather conditions."
