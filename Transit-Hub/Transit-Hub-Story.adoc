## Our story

When confronted with a new question, we create a jupyter-notebook to get the data and produce an artifact which addresses the question.


### The data chapter

All data enters via a pulsar-source-connectors, and is subsequently structured into databases.
The pulsar-source-connectors are written in kotlin and deployed to the pulsar-broker nodes (for reliability via redundancy).


### The process chapter

Jupyter-notebook is reworked to produce a set of widget suitable for use in https://panel.holoviz.org/

### The operator chapter

Traffic specialists will be able to create these dashboards from the provided widgets.
