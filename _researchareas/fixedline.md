We are also designing fixed-line and paratransit optimization algorithms that integrate with the microtransit dispatch system and use the energy prediction models to perform a system-wide optimization focusing on three objectives: minimizing energy per passenger per mile, minimizing total energy consumed, and maximizing the percentage of daily trips served by public transit. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and Monte-Carlo tree search form the core of our real-time operational optimization, which is supported by data-driven optimization for offline planning and by machine learning techniques for predicting demand, maintenance requirements, and traffic conditions. These methods can expand the coverage of the integrated design space and find solutions that are more efficient than classical heuristics.</p>
