We are developing microtransit dispatch algorithms that can serve passengers using dynamically generated routes and may expect passengers to make their way to and from common pick-up or drop-off points. Our hypothesis in the project is that the integration of data-driven methods with better operational research methods combined with a socially engaged design will lead to success. This approach will also be better than commercial alternatives, because most commercial alternatives have only economical objectives, and as such, those services are not designed to integrate with public transit and do not address equity issues. The outcome of the project will be a deployment-ready software system that can be used by an agency to design and operate a micro-transit service effectively.</p>
