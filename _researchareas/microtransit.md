We are developing microtransit dispatch algorithms that can serve passengers using dynamically generated routes and may expect passengers to make their way to and from common pick-up or drop-off points. Our hypothesis in the project is that the integration of data-driven methods with better operational research methods combined with a socially engaged design will lead to success. A key aspect of this research area is the development of techniques to preserve privacy across multimodal datasets, while also providing sufficient information for analysis and scheduling. This approach is different from commercial alternatives, because most commercial alternatives emphasize only on economic objectives, and as such, those services are often not integrated with public transit and do not address equity issues, which is a critical concern for us. The outcome of the project will be a deployment-ready software system that can be used to design and operate a micro-transit service effectively.
