  captionhead: Optimizing Transit Operations
  text: We work with Chattanooga Regional Transit Authority and Nashville WeGo to enable efficient transit operations by using artifical intelligence and real-time data analysis at scale. This includes reinforcement learning,  monte-carlo tree search and operations research based optimization methods for system-wide integrated scheduling and dispatch of transit operations. As part of this work we are also developing models to estimate loading factors and real-time energy consumption of mixed vehicle transit fleets and use those models to predict and optimize operations for lowering overall energy impact while ensuring the system wide capacity remains unaffected.
